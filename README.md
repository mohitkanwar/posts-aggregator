# posts-aggregator
The purpose of this project is to collate and aggregate posts from different platforms to be hosted on mohitkanwar.com - my personal blog.
I develop and create posts of different formats and for different platforms.
The posts include
1) Videos - hosted on Youtube
2) Images - primarily to be hosted on linked-in
3) Blogs - primarily to be hosted on medium
4) Thoughts - primarily to be hosted on twitter/koo
5) Presentations - primarily to be hosted on Google slides or slideshare

Mohitkanwar.com is primarily an angular progressive web application which can be accessed via web or mobile. And will work as a single collection for myself to collate my thoughts.
This is a personal project and hence it needs to be zero or minimum costs.
Make use of free alternatives whereever possible.

Mohitkanwar.com is hosted on github pages.

##Images Collation steps
1) As of today, all posts are added in the github repo - brand-mohit which is a private repo
2) This tool needs to pick up the latest posts from this repo
3) This tool needs to create the meta data for the picked up posts
4) This tool needs to create different versions of the posts
   1) Web Friendly
   2) Mobile Friendly
5) This tool needs to push the changes to mohitkanwar.com so that latest posts are available for the users.
